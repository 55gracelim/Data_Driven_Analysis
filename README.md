# Data_Driven_Analysis
A Capstone project for NYU class: DS-UA 112 Introduction to Data Science. 

Analyzed the ratings data of 400 movies from 1097 research participants collected by a toy major entertainment corporation that is trying to get a better handle on both what makes a good movie as well as a better understanding of the viewers.

Built a multiple regression model to predict movie ratings based on different subsets of viewers’ identity factors, ran cross-vali- dation to avoid overfitting, then evaluated the accuracy of the model using RMSE and R^2.

Other skills used: data cleaning (NaN handling), data transformation (z-scoring), dimension reduction (PCA), Spearman’s cor- relation, silhouette and K-means clustering, hypothesis testing (Mann-Whitney U Test), ANOVA, data visualization.

Libraries used: scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scipy, math
